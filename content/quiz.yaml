  Q0a:
    - question: >-
        How much would an 11th sample add to the $T_{MRCA}$? Answer in
        terms of relative increase (in percent) to the $T_{MRCA}$ for
        10 samples. What implication does this have for the effect of
        sampling more sequences?
      type: numeric
      answers:
        - type: range
          correct: true
          range: [1.009, 1.011]
          feedback: >-
            Correct! Let $H_{10}=2(1-1/10)$ and $H_{11}=2(1-1/11)$ be
            the height of the tree with 10 samples and 11 samples,
            respectively. Then the relative increase is $(H_{11} -
            H_{10})/H_{10}$.
        - type: default
          feedback: >-
            Try again! Hint: calculate the $T_{MRCA}$ for both sample
            sizes and look at the relative ratio.

        The second time you draw from the exponential distribution, what
        is the value of the parameter lambda?
      type: numeric
      answers:
        - type: value
          correct: true
          feedback: >-
            Correct. The number of chromosomes is 3, which gives us
            lambda = 3 * (3 - 1) / 2 = 3
          value: 3
        - type: default
          feedback: >-
            Try again (hint: how many remaining chromosomes do you have?)

        The third time you draw from the exponential distribution, what

      type: numeric
      answers:
        - type: value
          correct: true
          feedback: >-
            Correct. The number of chromosomes is 2, which gives us
            lambda = 2 * (2 - 1) / 2 = 1
          value: 1

        Given our sample size of 4 chromosomes, what is the expected
        total branch length of a coalescent tree, when time is
        expressed in units of 2N generations? Express your answer as a
        rational number. Compare the value to your simulated result
        and comment on the observation.
      type: numeric
      answers:
        - type: range
          correct: true
          range: [1.8333332, 1.8333334]
          feedback: >-
            Correct. The total branch length is calculated as
            $2(1/(2-1) + 1/(3-1) + 1/(4-1)) = 2(1 + 1/2 + 1/3) = 11/6$

        Given $T_{total}=3$, what $\theta$ would give $S=5$?
      type: numeric
      answers:
        - type: range
          correct: true
          range: [3.333332, 3.333334]
          feedback: >-
            Correct. $\theta$ can be expressed as
            $\theta=\frac{2S}{T}=\frac{2*5}{3}$.
        - type: default
          feedback: >-
            Try again. Equate $S$ with the Poisson mean and solve for
            $\theta$.

        How many nodes are needed to represent a tree with $n=10$
        samples?
      type: numeric
      answers:
        - type: value
          correct: true
          value: 19
          feedback: >-
            Correct! The number of nodes is equal to $2n-1$.
        - type: default
          feedback: >-
            Try again. Hint: calculate the number of nodes for some
            values of $n$, say 2, 3, 4, and see if you can detect a
            pattern.
  Q4b:
    - question: >-
        How many edges are needed to represent a tree with $n=10$
        samples?
      type: numeric
      answers:
        - type: value
          correct: true
          value: 18
          feedback: >-
            Correct! The number of edges is equal to the number of
            nodes minus 1, or $2n-2$.

          feedback: >-
            Try again. Hint: calculate the number of edges for some
