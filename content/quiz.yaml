  tmrca:
    - question: >-
        Calculate the expected $T_{MRCA}$ for a coalescent tree with
        $n=10$ samples. How much would an 11th sample add to the
        $T_{MRCA}$? Answer in terms of relative increase (in percent)
        to the $T_{MRCA}$ for 10 samples. What implication does this
        have for the effect of sampling more sequences?
      type: numeric
      answers:
        - type: range
          correct: true
          range: [1.009, 1.011]
          feedback: >-
            Correct! Let $H_{10}=2(1-1/10)$ and $H_{11}=2(1-1/11)$ be
            the expected $T_{MRCA}$ of the tree with 10 samples and 11
            samples, respectively. Then the relative increase is
            $(H_{11} - H_{10})/H_{10}$.

            Adding more samples does not add substantially to the
            $T_{MRCA}$ when, say, $n>10$, but rather adds coalescent
            event close to the bottom of the tree. It is more
            important to add sites than samples to study genetic
            variation.

          feedback: >-
            Try again! Hint: calculate the $T_{MRCA}$ for both sample
            sizes and look at the relative ratio .

          correct: true
          feedback: >-
            Correct. The number of chromosomes is 3, which gives us

  total_branch_length:
    - question: >-
        Given our sample size of 4 chromosomes, what is the expected
        total branch length of a coalescent tree, when time is
        expressed in units of 2N generations? Express your answer as a
        rational number. Compare the value to your simulated result
        and comment on the observation.

        - type: range
          correct: true
          range: [1.8333332, 1.8333334]
          feedback: >-
            Correct. The total branch length is calculated as
            $2(1/(2-1) + 1/(3-1) + 1/(4-1)) = 2(1 + 1/2 + 1/3) = 11/6$

  theta_S5:

          range: [3.333332, 3.333334]
          feedback: >-
            Correct. $\theta$ can be expressed as
            $\theta=\frac{2S}{T}=\frac{2*5}{3}$.
        - type: default

          correct: true
          feedback: >-
            Correct! There are two mutations on the branch from sample
            1 to its ancestor. Since there is no explicit ordering of
            mutations, any sequence with two derived states
            (<tt>1</tt>) is correct.

        Same for sample 0, but now you order mutations from left to right?

        - answer: "001100"
          correct: true
          feedback: >-
            Correct! There are 0 mutations on the branch from sample 0
            to its ancestor 5, followed by two on the branch from 5 to
            the MRCA. Since we (arbitrarily) order mutations from left
            to right, the sequence is 001100.

          correct: false

          value: 2
          feedback: >-
            Correct! The internal branch from 5 to 6 is common to
            samples 0 and 2 and carries two mutations.
