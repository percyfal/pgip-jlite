        The second time you draw from the exponential distribution, what
        is the value of the parameter lambda?
      type: numeric
      answers:
        - type: value
          correct: true
          feedback: >-
            Correct. The number of chromosomes is 3, which gives us
            lambda = 3 * (3 - 1) / 2 = 3
          value: 3
        - type: range
          correct: false
          range: [0, 100]
          feedback: >-
            Try again (hint: how many remaining chromosomes do you have?)
